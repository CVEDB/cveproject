CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs) processes documents are listed below. Additional CNA documentation is [available here](http://cvedb.github.io/cveproject/docs/cna/resources/index.html).

### CVE Entry Submissions via git
These documents walk through how to set up your local environment to
submit CVE Entries in JSON format to CVE List. The Initial Tools doc
walks through basic info and requirements, and should be read first.
After that you can follow one of the other docs to finish setup based on your desired workflow.
