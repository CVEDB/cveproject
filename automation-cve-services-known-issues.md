title: CVE Services 2.1/CVE JSON 5.0 Soft Deploy – Known Issues
layout: page
---

[CVE Services 2.1 “Soft Deploy” Phase 2](https://cveproject.github.io/automation-transition#bulletin-number-10), completed on 10/25/2022, comprised the deployment of several components that must work very closely together to implement the new [CVE JSON 5.0](https://cveproject.github.io/automation-cve-services#json-overview) capabilities while maintaining the current CVE JSON 4.0 support.   

As the CNA community begins using CVE Services to submit and manage CVE Records, if you notice an issue, <a href="mailto:awg@cve-CWE-Programs.groups.io">please report it</a> to the [CVE Program Automation Working Group (AWG)](https://www.cve.org/ProgramOrganization/WorkingGroups#AutomationWorkingGroupAWG).

## How to Report an Issue

If you observe anomalous behavior in any of the three workflows listed below, submit your observation to the AWG at <a href="mailto:awg@cve-CWE-Programs.groups.io">awg@cve-cwe-programs.groups.io</a> and we will work to document the issue and get it resolved:

<ol>
<li>CVE Services submission workflow (CVE JSON 5.0)</li>
<li>CVEList GitHub Pilot submissions workflow (CVE JSON 4.0)</li>
<li>CVE Program Request web forms submissions workflow (CVE JSON 4.0)</li>
</ol>

## Immediate Priority Issues

Below are known issues for [CVE Services 2.1](https://cveproject.github.io/automation-cve-services#services-overview)/[CVE JSON 5.0](https://cveproject.github.io/automation-cve-services#json-overview) Soft Deploy. These issues are being addressed as “high priorities” and solutions are being developed. 

CNAs preparing to transition to [CVE Services - Record Submission and Upload Service (RSUS)](https://cveproject.github.io/automation-cve-services#services-overview) should review these issues and understand the impact that they may have on their CVE Record management.

<ul>
    <li><strong>Conversion of the “Affected” field of CVE JSON 5.0 records to CVE JSON 4.0 does not accurately convert “version ranges”</strong><br/>
IMPORTANT: Please refrain from using version ranges in CVE JSON 5.0 records until a solution is developed. Records requiring a version range in the affected field may continue to be submitted in CVE JSON 4.0.</li>
    <br/>
    <li><strong>CVE JSON 5.0 “REJECTED” state only partially supports CVE JSON 4.0 conversion for CVE List.</strong></li>
    <br/>
    <li><strong>When a CVE JSON 5.0 record is submitted in the “REJECTED” sate, the CVE List will show that the state is “REJECT”, but the description will not contain the “**REJECT**” text.</strong><br/>
If a CNA wishes to submit a CVE JSON 5.0 record and is subsequently required to reject the record, contact the Secretariat for that support using the <a href="https://cveform.mitre.org/">CVE Program Request web forms</a> (select the “Other” form) until the problem is resolved.</li>
    <br/>
    <li><strong>CVE JSON 5.0 “DISPUTED” tag is not supported on CVE JSON 4.0 down conversion for CVE List.</strong><br/>
When a CVE JSON 5.0 record is submitted with the “DISPUTED” tag it will not be propagated to the CVE JSON 4.0 CVE List or the GitHub/bulk download file.<br/><br/>
If a CNA wishes to submit a CVE JSON 5.0 record and subsequently is required to “dispute” the record, contact the Secretariat for that support using the <a href="https://cveform.mitre.org/">CVE Program Request web forms</a> (select the “Other” form).</li>
   <br/>
   <li><strong>Secretariat Service to add references to CVE Records may be degraded.</strong><br/>
Secretariat staff may need to manually add references for some CVE Records. Records submitted through the  <a href="https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelist">CVEList GitHub Pilot</a> and the <a href="https://cveform.mitre.org/">CVE Program Request web forms</a> are unaffected.</li>
</ul>
