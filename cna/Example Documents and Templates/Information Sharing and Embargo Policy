Information Sharing and Embargo Policy

This document provides the Information Sharing and Embargo Policy for MITRE as the Primary CNA and publisher of the CVE list.  For information on the type of information that MITRE collects, how it is used, and what information may be provided to third parties, please refer to the CVE Privacy Policy located at https://cve.mitre.org/about/privacy_policy.html.

As part of the CVE ID assignment request, MITRE accepts private/privileged information in addition to publicly disclosed information. MITRE will not share any private/privileged information provided and the information provided to MITRE is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. If the private/privileged information becomes public MITRE may add that information as a public reference to the CVE ID entry.

The CVE list, published by MITRE, contains entries of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. That is, CVE is not an initial public discloser of vulnerability information and CVE IDs are not assigned to vulnerabilities that will never be made public. The CVE list is publicly available and all CVE feeds and formats are available to all users.  If MITRE receives a request for more information regarding a particular vulnerability, MITRE will refer the requestor to the originator of the CVE entry. 

It is the policy of MITRE that CVE ID requests are not visible to persons with any perceived conflict of interest with the CVE program. CVE ID requests may be read by persons who are MITRE employees and/or contractors. These persons must not work for other organizations that request CVE IDs, use CVE IDs, or produce or sell products that may have CVEs (i.e., customer-controlled products of software or computer hardware). MITRE does not provide any preferential treatment of CVE ID requests that originate within MITRE or that relate to products produced or used by MITRE.
