Suggested Rules Changes

These are suggested changes to the CNA Rules. These changes have not been vetted, and they may not have been fully developed or discussed. As suggestions are developed and discussed by the Board and the CNA community, this list will be updated to indicate if each suggestion will be incorporated or declined.

Comments can be added to each item or included in the Git comment system.

- 2.2.9 has a typo at the end.

- Clarify the difference between "when a vulnerability is made public" versus "when a vulnerability is added to the CVE list" and how they affect each other.

- Better define "hardware" with regard to CVE.

- Better describe the nested Root CNA structure (with a new diagram?).

- Should the requirement that CVE assignments must be public or planned to be made public be removed?
  - Should there be a new record type: "Not Public". This would accommodate the use case of a CVE ID being assigned without there being an intention for it to ever be made public (outside of the CNA's internal operation).

- Should the original reservation entity or reservation chain be added to required data?

- Should "Description" be excluded from the required fields in Appendix B?

- Add references and rules updates regarding the CVE JSON format and its use.
______

- Dan Adinolfi

- Add a rule that states a CNA must provide a page on their web site which lists the products for which they accept vulnerability reports. This includes a listing of EOL (or other) software that are explicitly _not_ covered.

______

- Kurt Seifried

- Ensure discoverability of the CNA coverage page (e.g. they list the URL in their CNA entry?)

- Ensure some normalized format for the data, e.g. JSON? a simple list?

- Should we also allow projects/etc. to simply embed the data into their CNA listing, especially if it is "simple" (e.g. an Open Source project with a single software project, or a project with multiple projects that are well defined (e.g. within their GitHub organization) where they cover "everything" for example

- Page 5 of the current CNA rules state:
"In cases where requests or issues cannot be resolved by a given CNA, the issues are escalated to the next higher level CNA."
Provide examples of the kinds of issues that might cause escalations. Also, create rule that requires some kind of paper trail for attempts to work with the CNA.


______

The current CNA rules do not stipulate a specific time by which a CNA should update their upstream CNA after a CVE ID has been made public. MITRE asked the Board for guidance on the most time a CNA can wait. The Board suggested that CNAs should update their upstream CNAs within 24 hours of the publication of a CVE ID. This recommendation will be added to the list of updates to be considered for the next CNA Rules update.

Additionally, CVE IDs that have been reserved for long periods of time without any public assignment could be “REJECT”ed or labeled in some other way to indicate they are inactive in the CVE list.

Go through the CNA docs and highlight some of the potentially undefined/problematic terms/phrases, e.g. "public disclosure" and so on is so that we can maybe define them better. 
______

3 May 2017

Clarification around disclosure policies and what kinds of vulnerabilities (public, non-public, etc.) are given CVE IDs by the CNA and for what specific scope. Include a policy template. (Review the Embargo and Disclosure template)

_____

Revision Process:

Revisions will be made in Git.

Create a template for submissions to the CNA Rules revision process.
  - Goal
  - Proposed solution
  - Expected Outcome
  - Proposed language (optional)

First 30 days
  - open comment period
  - Board and CNAs
  - Use above format for revisions
  - 2 or 3 conference calls
  
 Next 60 days
  - 1 week sprints with a subset of the proposed revisions each sprint. Each subset is only to be discussed during that sprint.
  - 8 total sprints.
  - At the end of a sprint, if something wasn't resolved or discussed, it will not be included in this revision.
  - At the end of all sprints, the document will be finalized and sent to the Board for approval.
  
Proposed: New Rules go into affect on Jan 1, 2018
