- 2.2.9 has a typo at the end.

- Clarify the difference between "when a vulnerability is made public" versus "when a vulnerability is added to the CVE list" and how they affect each other.

- Better define "hardware" with regard to CVE.

- Better describe the nested Root CNA structure (with a new diagram?).

- Should the requirement that CVE assignments must be public or planned to be made public be removed?
  - Should there be a new record type: "Not Public". This would accommodate the use case of a CVE ID being assigned without there being an intention for it to ever be made public (outside of the CNA's internal operation).

- Should the original reservation entity or reservation chain be added to required data?

- Should "Description" be excluded from the required fields in Appendix B?

- Add references and rules updates regarding the CVE JSON format and its use.

- Add a rule that states a CNA must provide a page on their web site which lists the products for which they accept vulnerability reports. This includes a listing of EOL (or other) software that are explicitly _not_ covered.

- Page 5 of the current CNA rules state:
"In cases where requests or issues cannot be resolved by a given CNA, the issues are escalated to the next higher level CNA."
Provide examples of the kinds of issues that might cause escalations. Also, create rule that requires some kind of paper trail for attempts to work with the CNA.
