The process for resolving incidents where a CNA has not followed the CNA rules is as follows.
 
When a specific problem is presented to the Primary CNA (or to the Root CNA above the CNA in question) or the Board, the Primary/Root CNA will reach out to the parties involved to get an understanding of both sides of the story. If the CNA has been violating the CNA Rules, the Primary/Root CNA will work with the CNA to ensure they understand the rules and work with them to improve their processes such that they conform to the rules.
 
The Board will be made aware of the results of the incident, but the Board will not be asked to act unless the Board deems it is necessary or if the remediation effort fails. At that point, the Board will formally take on the issue, gather information on the issue, and decide on an action. If the Board chooses to remove the CNA from the program, the removal will be done through a majority vote.
 
If a CNA has been removed, they can reapply for participation in the CNA program after a year.
 
It is important that any action taken against a CNA is done through the community and with the oversight of the Board. Ideally, a problem will be resolved without removing the CNA, but using removal as a potential consequence is on the table.
